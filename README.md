# Supporting materials for the UTD 2019 Hackathon

The Fannie Mae Public API Portal can be found at: https://developer.theexchange.fanniemae.com/

There is no cost to create an account and any information published here is available to the public.

You can also find sample source code and background / reference information about working with the data on this site.
The sample code demonstrates using the API to query different datasets, visualizing results using the Bokeh library, and a few other aspects of working with the data.

In addition to the data available from the API Portal you can also come to the Fannie Mae table to pick up a DVD containing additional data that covers a longer period of time.

Remember - in this challenge we're asking you to use data from Fannie Mae to accomplish one of the following:
 - Combine the Fannie MAe data with other online sources to create an app that helps potential home-buyers identify where whey might like
   to live
 - Create a "risk analysis" system that predicts whether a loan might go into default - representing risk for the company
 - Develop an application that displays mortgage purchse data in interesting and unique ways. Combine Fannie Mae data with Google Maps
   or Google Earth, create an AR/VR display app, built Alexa into the user interface and drive the data displays with your voice.
