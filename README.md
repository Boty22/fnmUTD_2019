Fannie Mae Public API Portal can be found at: https://developer.theexchange.fanniemae.com/

There is no cost to create an account and any information published here is available to the public.

You can also find sample source code and background / reference information about working with the data on this site.
The sample code demonstrates using the API to query different datasets, visualizing results using the Bokeh library, and a few other aspects of working with the data.

In addition to the data available from the API Portal you can also come to the Fannie Mae table to pick up a DVD containing additional data.
